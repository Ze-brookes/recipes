Content Management Systems â€“ why they are neededWordPress, Joomla, Drupal and Netlifyâ€¦ what do they all have in common?
Yes! Thatâ€™s right they are all content management systems â€“ I hope the title didnâ€™t give it away ðŸ¤”â€¦
Anywayâ€¦ what is a content management system (CMS)? A quick google search would inform you that a CMS is a software application that allows a user to change and design their web content without having to face markup language or coding.
This makes CMSs ideal for many publishing companies as they do not have to spend time and money on training their employees on how to use data in order to change their website.
A CMS platforms can come in the form of open-source or closed-source. Open-source platforms such as Netlify, tend to be updated more frequently tends to be more user-friendly. Closed-source platforms tend to be designed with specific industries in mind such as the book publishing, news websites or magazine publishing.
CMS makes it easy for the user to write and style their content on a platform that looks similar to Microsoft Word. However when using Netlify ensure that if you choose to plainly copy and paste your content from Word. If you copy and paste directly from Word (e.g. just using the ctrl + v shortcut) it will bring coding jargon from Microsoft word into your interface. Another way to avoid this is to type your information directly into the CMSâ€™s interface.
If you were to use Netlify CMS one of the advantages is that it is linked to your Git repository, where content and code will be stored for your website, which makes it easier to configure your content.
However if you would like to use another CMS here is a very basic and general guide for your website:
1.	Ensure that you first pay for domain name and web hosting
2.	Install your CMS
3.	Play around with your CMS in order to arrange your website
