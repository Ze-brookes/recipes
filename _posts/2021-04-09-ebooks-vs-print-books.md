Which do you prefer? The print book or the ebook?

You most likely have a preference. [Nielsen](https://nielsenbook.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2020/09/Research_Brochure.pdf) from their survey in 2018 that 28% of used ebooks as opposed to the 58% who use print books. With smart technology basically on our wrists, why do you think people might prefer reading a physical book?

Now I can't speak for the 58% as I'm pretty sure I wasn't part of that survey but I do prefer reading from a print book when it comes to certain occasions. 

However you cannot deny how useful ebooks have been and are.

Ebooks have been great for students who need to look up quick information without having to go to a physical library which might not even be in the same country. That reason is one of many.

So what are ebooks?

Two types of ebooks:

1. Re-flowable
2. Fixed layout



Well don't worry because I can give you 7 points on how ebooks and prints are useful in their spheres but also why a person may chose one over the other.
