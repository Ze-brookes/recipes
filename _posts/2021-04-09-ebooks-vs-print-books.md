Which do you prefer? The printbook or the ebook?

You most likely have a preference. Nielsen from their survey in 2018 that 28% of used ebooks as opposed to the 58% who use print books. With smart technology basically on our wrists, why do you think people might prefer reading a physical book?

Now I can't speak for the 58% as I'm pretty sure I wasn't part of that survey but I do prefer reading from a print book when it comes to certain occassions but you cannot deny how useful ebooks have been. Oh you don't know?

Two types of ebooks:

re-flowable

Fixed layout



Well don't worry because I can give you 7 points on how ebooks and prints are useful in their spheres but also why a person may chose one over the other.
