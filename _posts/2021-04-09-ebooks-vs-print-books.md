Which do you prefer?

The printbook or the ebook?

You most likely have a preference but you cannot deny how useful ebooks have been. Oh you don't know?

Well don't worry because I can give you 7 points on how ebooks and prints are useful in their spheres but also why a person may chose one over the other.
