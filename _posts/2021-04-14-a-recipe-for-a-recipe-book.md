As I am currently designing a small recipe ebook I thought I would write a blog, not only as an abstract log of this journey but to also give a little advice to anyone who may want to create a mini-recipe ebook. So now we commence...

What makes a good recipe book? Is it solely the recipe of the entire format of the book? Is it the design?

Arguably it's that and more.

Do you remember my previous blog on the different ebook [formats](https://www.creativestudiosderby.co.uk/fixed-layout-vs-reflowable-epubs-indesign-ebook-formats-explained/): *fixed-layout* and *reflowable?* (Go back if you're not too sure about what I'm talking about ðŸ˜Š) Well, definitely take this into consideration when choosing to make a Recipe ebook.

A fixed-layout allows you to take interactivity into consideration for you cookbook, and is a potentially a better option when considering 

Whilst constructing a recipe book on InDesign try to remember a few things:

1. Co-ordination: Make sure that your spreads are enough for each theme that you plan to have for your ebook

   * Ensure that you pick the correct template size and format for your book
2.
