Hello again and welcome back to the blog! Always lovely to see you. Now if you have read the last blog you would probably deem it slightly odd to have read about CMS and how great they are for managing web content with the need to know any coding. However, for those who want to immerse themselves in the world of code it would be nice to share in breadth knowledge.
Contents for this blog includes:

1. What a text editor is?
   1a. why is it important?
2. What is Atom?
3. How you can use Atom to start coding?
