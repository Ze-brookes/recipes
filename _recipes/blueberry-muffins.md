### Ingredients

* 195 grams plain flour
* 150 grams granulated sugar
* 1/4 teaspoon fine sea salt
* 2 teaspoons baking powder
* 80 ml vegetable oil
* 1 large egg
* 80 ml – 120 ml milk – dairy and non-dairy are fine
* 1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract
* 125 grams fresh or frozen blueberries – do not defrost the berries


### Method

**STEP 1**
Pre-heat oven to 200oC.

**STEP 2**
Whisk the flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt in a large bowl.

**STEP 3**
Add the 80 ml oil to a measuring jug that holds at least 240ml. Add the egg then fill the jug to the 240 ml mark with milk. Add vanilla and whisk to combine.

**STEP 4**
Add milk mixture to the bowl with dry ingredients then use a fork to combine. Do not over mix. (The muffin batter should be quite thick but scoopable. Fold in the blueberries.

**STEP 5**
Divide the batter between muffin cups. If you desire muffin-tops make sure the mixture is quite close the top.

**STEP 6**
Bake muffins 15 to 20 minutes or until tops are no longer wet and a toothpick inserted into the middle of a muffin comes out with crumbs, not wet batter. Transfer to a cooling rack.
